# Replication-Oil-elections-and-fiscal-transparency
Replication material for the article "Oil, Elections and Fiscal Transparency" from European Journal of Political Research
The replication of the main analysis in the paper is done by using the "Dataset oil, elections & fiscal transparency collection year with V-dem data" 
and the "Oil, elections and fiscal transparency dofile final" dofile. 
The other dataset and dofile is for the analysis where the 2014 fiscal transparency data is added to the analysis (confer footnote 14).
